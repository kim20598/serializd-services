Idea is taken from [here](https://github.com/Hame-daani/letterboxd_util) , [here](https://github.com/pypp/letterboxd-services/).

serializd Services is a Chrome extension that will make it easier by providing you with free services for tv shows straight through [serializd](https://serializd.com/) page
